    <h2><b>How Berserk changed my life</b></h2>
    <p>I love Anime and Manga but none has had as deep of an effect on me personally than Berserk by Kentaro Miura. Who
        sadly passed away on May 6th, 2021.</p>
    <p>Although it's notorious for its over the top use of explicit violence and heavy themes, His dark fantasy epic
        helped me a lot when I was depressed and going through some of the hardest times in my life.</p></div>

                <p>The main protagonist of the Berserk series, his ordeals showed me that with willpower and
                    determination anything is possible, and that this too shall pass. </p>
