                <h2>Berserk and my depression.</h2>
                <p>In the early summer of ‘97 when I was coming home from my 8th grade class trip to Washington D.C. that both my twin sister and I went on, it was she who first noticed that the way we were going home wasn’t the usual way. After that, my older sister and my mother broke down and told us that we were evicted and now living in the basement of a family friend we lost everything all my clothes, toys, and personal belongings it sucked</p>
                    <p>That was when my first real obsession with Anime started, it was at first just an escape from my terrible situation, anything to distract me from my home life and my start as an angsty teenager. I was drawn to dark and edgy things because that's all that made sense to me at the time, I hated everything, and I was angry with the world so when I stumbled on to Berserk. It was right up my alley.</p>
                     <p>It was brutal and violent everything a teenage boy would love but as I watched more of the Anime and eventually bought and read the Manga, it changed my perspective in life and has help me to understand that life is just unfair sometimes and there is nothing you can do about it. There's no point in being mad at the hurricane, but you can make sure to never give up.</p> 
                    <p>The only thing you can control in those situations are your emotions and to plant your feet and keep moving forward. the horrible things that happened to the main characters are nothing compared to my actual life but see someone endure the limits of human suffering like the main character Guts went through and keep standing was so inspiring and game changing to me this series will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
                    <p>On May 6th, 2021 the Author Kentaro Miura passed away he was 54 years old.</p>
                    <p>He died before completing his story.</p>

                <p>The main protagonist of the Berserk series, his ordeals showed me that with willpower and
                    determination anything is possible, and that this too shall pass. </p>
